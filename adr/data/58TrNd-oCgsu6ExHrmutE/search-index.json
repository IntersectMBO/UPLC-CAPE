Multi-View Approach for Benchmark Scenario Specification","verbatim":"\nTechnical Story: Refactor the monolithic fibonacci benchmark template by extracting individual files for different view types (state machine, behavioral scenarios, implementation logic).\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThe initial fibonacci benchmark scenario was specified as a single monolithic document that mixed different types of specification concerns: lifecycle visualization, behavioral test cases, and algorithmic implementation details. This approach created several issues:\n\n1. **Cognitive overload**: Developers had to parse through different types of information to find what they needed\n2. **Maintenance complexity**: Changes to one aspect (e.g., test scenarios) required editing a large document containing unrelated concerns\n3. **Poor reusability**: Different stakeholders needed different views but had to consume the entire specification\n4. **Inconsistent abstraction levels**: The document mixed high-level state transitions with low-level implementation details\n\nHow can we structure benchmark scenario specifications to be more maintainable, consumable, and aligned with best practices for smart contract specification?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Need for clear separation of concerns in specification documents\n- Research findings advocating for multi-view specification approaches for smart contracts\n- Desire to make scenarios argument-agnostic and reusable across different test cases\n- Goal to improve maintainability and reduce cognitive load for different stakeholder groups\n- Alignment with established software engineering practices for specification documentation\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Single monolithic document** (current approach)\n2. **Multi-view approach with three distinct views**\n3. **Fully formal specification using mathematical notation**\n4. **Code-first approach with minimal documentation**\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Multi-view approach with three distinct views\", because it directly addresses the identified problems while following research-backed best practices for smart contract specification.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- **Improved maintainability**: Each view can be updated independently without affecting others\n- **Better stakeholder alignment**: Different roles can focus on their relevant view (auditors on behavioral scenarios, implementers on logic view, etc.)\n- **Enhanced reusability**: Views are argument-agnostic and can be applied to different test cases\n- **Clearer documentation structure**: Each view has a specific purpose and abstraction level\n- **Reduced cognitive load**: Stakeholders can consume only the information relevant to their needs\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- **Increased file count**: Three files instead of one per scenario\n- **Cross-reference complexity**: Need to maintain consistency across multiple views\n- **Initial learning curve**: Contributors need to understand the multi-view approach\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Single monolithic document\n\nCurrent approach where all specification aspects are in one file.\n\n- Good, because simple file structure with everything in one place\n- Good, because no cross-reference management needed\n- Bad, because creates cognitive overload for readers\n- Bad, because difficult to maintain as scenarios grow in complexity\n- Bad, because mixes different abstraction levels inappropriately\n\n### Multi-view approach with three distinct views\n\nThree separate files: state machine view, behavioral scenarios view, and implementation logic view.\n\n- Good, because aligns with established specification practices for smart contract development\n- Good, because provides clear separation of concerns\n- Good, because enables stakeholder-specific consumption\n- Good, because improves maintainability through modular structure\n- Good, because makes scenarios argument-agnostic and more reusable\n- Bad, because increases file count and cross-reference complexity\n- Bad, because requires initial learning investment for contributors\n\n### Fully formal specification using mathematical notation\n\nMathematical specification using formal methods notation.\n\n- Good, because provides unambiguous specification\n- Good, because enables formal verification\n- Bad, because requires specialized knowledge to read and write\n- Bad, because not accessible to most smart contract developers\n- Bad, because overkill for benchmark scenario specification\n\n### Code-first approach with minimal documentation\n\nMinimal documentation with primary specification in reference implementations.\n\n- Good, because executable specification that can't drift from implementation\n- Good, because familiar to developers\n- Bad, because ties specification to specific programming languages\n- Bad, because makes cross-compiler comparison more difficult\n- Bad, because reduces accessibility for non-implementers (auditors, stakeholders)\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe multi-view approach consists of three distinct files per scenario:\n\n### 1. State Machine View (`*-state-machine.md`)\n\n- **Purpose**: High-level lifecycle visualization\n- **Content**: Mermaid state diagrams embedded in markdown, state descriptions, transition conditions\n- **Audience**: All stakeholders seeking high-level understanding\n\n### 2. Behavioral Scenarios View (`*-behavioral-scenarios.md`)\n\n- **Purpose**: Concrete test cases and expected outcomes\n- **Content**: Gherkin scenarios covering happy paths and edge cases\n- **Audience**: Testers, auditors, quality assurance\n\n### 3.

The mode system added unnecessary complexity; the scenario-based approach achieves the same goals more simply.\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nUPLC-CAPE users have two distinct benchmarking needs that are sometimes in conflict:\n\n1. **Compiler Comparison** (Group A): Users want to compare compiler optimization effectiveness in isolation by having all submissions implement the **same algorithm**. This provides apples-to-apples comparison where performance differences reflect compiler capabilities rather than algorithmic choices.\n\n2. **Real-World Competition** (Group B): Users want submissions to showcase ecosystem capabilities using **any optimizations or algorithms** (memoization, metaprogramming, different algorithms). This reflects practical deployment strategies and compiler USPs.\n\nCurrently, the framework allows any implementation approach, but all submissions compete in a single pool. This makes it impossible to isolate compiler effectiveness from algorithmic choices, frustrating both user groups.\n\n**Question**: How can we support both pure compiler comparison and open optimization competition within the same framework?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Must satisfy both user groups without forcing them into a single evaluation mode\n- Should enable multiple optimization experiments per compiler/author\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing submissions\n- Should provide clear, self-documenting organization\n- Must be intuitive for new users while supporting advanced workflows\n- Should facilitate both academic research and practical developer guidance\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Separate Scenario Types** -

Two evaluation modes with flexible slug identifiers\n4. **Tag-Based System** - Use metadata tags for algorithmic constraints\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: **\"Base/Open Mode System with Slugs\"**, because it:\n\n- Provides clear semantic distinction between evaluation contexts (\"base\" = prescribed algorithm, \"open\" = any optimization)\n- Enables multiple experiments per compiler via descriptive slugs\n- Maintains single scenario definition (no duplication)\n- Scales to any number of optimization variants\n- Is backward compatible (existing submissions → \"open_default\")\n- Uses familiar terminology (\"mode\" aligns with compilation contexts)\n\n### Implementation Overview\n\n**Two Evaluation Modes:**\n\n1. **\"base\" mode**: Implements exact algorithm prescribed in scenario specification\n   -

After implementation and community feedback, several issues were identified:\n\n**Problems with the Mode System:**\n\n1. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The mode attribute added an extra dimension to track across metadata, CLI flags, directory naming, and reporting\n2. **Verbose Documentation**: Scenario docs grew to 221-230 lines, including extensive mode-specific guidance that overwhelmed implementors\n3. **Confusing Reporting**: HTML reports separated base/open modes within the same scenario, creating cognitive overhead\n4. **Unclear Semantics**: The concept of \"modes\" within a single scenario was less intuitive than having separate scenarios\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\n\n- \"The 'mode' as implemented adds too much complexity\"\n- \"Scenario descriptions are too verbose for implementors\"\n- \"Common submission instructions should be extracted\"\n- \"Instead of mode=base, we should have dedicated scenarios like `fibonacci_naive_recursion`\"\n\n**Question**: How can we achieve the same goal (prescribed vs. open optimization benchmarks) with less complexity and better clarity?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Reduce cognitive overhead for users (implementors and report readers)\n- Simplify metadata schema and CLI interface\n- Make scenario intent immediately clear from directory structure\n- Extract common guidance to avoid duplication\n- Maintain backward compatibility path for existing submissions\n- Enable future growth with additional constraint variations\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Keep Mode System** - Retain base/open modes with incremental improvements\n2. **Scenario-Based Approach** - Create dedicated scenarios for prescribed algorithms\n3. **Tag-Based System** - Use metadata tags instead of mode field\n4. **Hybrid Approach** - Combine scenarios with optional mode flags\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: **\"Scenario-Based Approach\"**, because it:\n\n- Eliminates the mode attribute entirely (simpler metadata and CLI)\n- Makes intent immediately clear from scenario name (`fibonacci` vs `fibonacci_naive_recursion`)\n- Reduces scenario documentation by 70-80% (from ~220 lines to ~40-60 lines)\n- Enables natural growth (can add `fibonacci_iterative`, `fibonacci_memoized`, etc. as separate scenarios)\n- Simplifies HTML reports (back to simple scenario-based organization)\n- Follows principle of \"make the common case simple\" (most users want either prescribed OR open, rarely both)\n\n### Implementation Overview\n\n**New Scenario Structure:**\n\n```\nscenarios/\n├── fibonacci/                    #

variant in name\ncape submission list fibonacci_naive_recursion\ncape submission report fibonacci\n```\n\n**HTML Report Restoration:**\n\n- Return to pre-mode format: single table per scenario\n- `fibonacci` and `fibonacci_naive_recursion` are independent scenarios with separate reports\n- No mode filtering or grouping logic\n- Simpler, more predictable navigation\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- **70-80% reduction in scenario doc length**: From 221-230 lines to 40-60 lines\n- **Eliminated CLI complexity**: No `--mode` or `--slug` flags to remember\n- **Clearer intent**: Scenario name immediately indicates constraints\n- **Simpler metadata**: Fewer required fields, less validation complexity\n- **Better organization**: Common guidance in single location (`doc/submission-guide.md`)\n- **Natural extensibility**: Easy to add `fibonacci_iterative`, `factorial_tail_recursive`, etc.\n- **Simpler reports**: Back to straightforward scenario-based tables\n- **Lower maintenance**: Less code to maintain (no mode filtering throughout)\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- **Breaking change**: Requires migration of existing submissions\n- **More scenario directories**: `fibonacci_naive_recursion` adds directory (but clearer)\n- **Potential proliferation**: Could lead to many scenario variants (but this is actually a feature for fine-grained benchmarking)\n- **Migration effort**: All existing metadata.json files must be updated\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Option 1: Keep Mode System\n\n- Good, because no migration needed\n- Good, because mode concept is familiar from compilation contexts\n- Bad, because adds complexity to metadata, CLI, and reports\n- Bad, because scenario docs remain too long (220+ lines)\n- Bad, because mode semantics less clear than scenario names\n- Bad, because feedback indicates it's \"too much complexity\"\n\n### Option 2: Scenario-Based Approach (CHOSEN)\n\n- Good, because scenario name immediately indicates intent\n- Good, because massive documentation simplification (70-80% reduction)\n- Good, because eliminates mode attribute entirely\n- Good, because simpler CLI and metadata schema\n- Good, because enables natural growth (add scenarios as needed)\n- Good, because addresses all feedback points\n- Bad, because requires migration of existing submissions\n- Bad, because creates more top-level scenario directories\n\n### Option 3: Tag-Based System\n\n- Good, because flexible tagging without directory changes\n- Bad, because tags hidden in metadata (less discoverable)\n- Bad, because doesn't solve documentation verbosity\n- Bad, because still requires attribute in metadata\n- Bad, because unclear semantics (what tags mean what?)\n\n### Option 4: Hybrid Approach\n\n- Good, because could combine benefits\n- Bad, because adds even more complexity\n- Bad, because doesn't address core feedback about simplification\n- Bad, because would still have verbose documentation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Scenario Creation\n\nNew scenarios created with prescribed algorithms:\n\n- `scenarios/fibonacci_naive_recursion/` - Naive recursive fibonacci implementation required\n- `scenarios/factorial_naive_recursion/` - Naive recursive factorial implementation required\n\nEach includes:\n\n- Streamlined `.md` spec (~40-60 lines)\n- `cape-tests.json` for verification\n- Same structure as existing scenarios\n\n### Documentation Extraction\n\nCreate `doc/submission-guide.md` containing:\n\n- **Metrics Explanation**: What CPU units, memory units, script size, term size mean\n- **Acceptance Criteria**: Correctness, budget compliance, determinism, self-contained, valid format\n- **Validation Workflow**: Commands to verify and measure submissions\n- **File Requirements**: What files are needed (uplc, metadata.json, metrics.json, README.md)\n- **Templates**: Links to schema and template files\n- **Common Checklist**: Steps all submissions should follow\n\nAll scenario docs link to this guide instead of duplicating content.\n\n### Migration Strategy\n\n**Existing Submissions:**\n\n1. Create new scenario directories:\n   - `submissions/fibonacci_naive_recursion/`\n   - `submissions/factorial_naive_recursion/`\n\n2. Migrate base mode submissions:\n   - `fibonacci/*_base/` → `fibonacci_naive_recursion/*/` (remove `_base` suffix)\n   - `factorial/*_base/` → `factorial_naive_recursion/*/` (remove `_base` suffix)\n\n3. Migrate open mode submissions:\n   - `fibonacci/*_open/` → `fibonacci/*/` (remove `_open` suffix)\n   - `factorial/*_open/` → `factorial/*/` (remove `_open` suffix)\n   - `factorial/*_open_pfix/` → `factorial/*_pfix/` (remove `_open_`, keep variant)\n\n4. Update all `metadata.json` files:\n   - Remove `\"mode\": \"base|open\"` field\n   - Remove `\"slug\": \"...\"` field (if present)\n\n**CLI Updates:**\n\nRemove from all affected scripts:\n\n- `--mode base|open` flag and associated logic\n- `--slug <name>` flag and associated logic\n- Mode-based filtering in list/report/aggregate commands\n- Mode-based directory naming logic\n\n**Schema Updates:**\n\nRemove from `submissions/TEMPLATE/metadata.schema.json`:\n\n- `submission.mode` field (was required)\n- `submission.slug` field (was optional)\n\nUpdate `metadata-template.json` accordingly.\n\n**Report Generation:**\n\nRestore pre-mode report format:\n\n- Remove mode filtering/grouping\n- Each scenario gets its own independent report\n- `fibonacci` and `fibonacci_naive_recursion` treated as separate scenarios\n- Simple scenario-based navigation\n\n### Verification Strategy\n\n**Scenario Compliance:**\n\nFor prescribed scenarios (`_naive_recursion`):\n\n- Community review during PR process\n- Submission README explains algorithm compliance\n- Reviewers verify against scenario specification\n- Honor system with clear guidelines\n\nFor open scenarios:\n\n- No algorithmic constraints\n- Only correctness verification via `cape-tests.json`\n- Variant suffix (e.g., `_memoized`) for documentation only\n\n## Applicability\n\n**When to Use Prescribed Scenarios:**\n\n- Synthetic benchmarks where algorithm can be clearly specified\n- Compiler comparison needs (isolate compiler effectiveness)\n- Educational purposes (demonstrate optimization of specific algorithm)\n\n**When to Use Open Scenarios:**\n\n- Real-world scenarios (complex validators)\n- Optimization showcases (best achievable performance)\n- Exploring different algorithmic approaches\n\n**Growth Pattern:**\n\n- Start with open scenario (e.g., `fibonacci`)\n- Add prescribed variants as needed (e.g., `fibonacci_naive_recursion`, `fibonacci_iterative`)\n- Each scenario is self-contained and independently useful\n\n## Migration Timeline\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Create new scenarios and documentation (fibonacci_naive_recursion, factorial_naive_recursion, submission-guide.md)\n2. **Phase 2**: Remove mode system from CLI and schemas\n3. **Phase 3**: Migrate existing submissions\n4. **Phase 4**: Restore HTML report format\n5. **Phase 5**: Update tests and project documentation\n6. **Phase 6**: Final verification and testing\n\nEstimated total effort: 20-26 hours\n\n## Links\n\n- [GitHub Issue #59](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/UPLC-CAPE/issues/59) - Original feature request for base/open mode system\n- [GitHub PR #60](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/UPLC-CAPE/pull/60) - Implementation of mode system (now superseded)\n- Supersedes: <AdrLink slug=\"20251006-baseopen-mode-system-with-submission-slugs\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Base/Open Mode System with Submission Slugs\" customLabel=\"ADR 20251006: Base/Open Mode System\" />\n"}],["20251017-uplc-pretty-printing-integration",{"title":"UPLC Pretty-Printing Integration","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nUPLC files (`.uplc`) in the repository are often minified or inconsistently formatted, making them difficult to review, compare, and debug. The `plutus` executable from the Plutus repository provides pretty-printing capabilities via its output flag (`-o`), but there was no convenient way to:\n\n1. Pretty-print UPLC files in place\n2. Automatically format UPLC files as part of the development workflow\n3. Ensure consistent formatting across all submissions\n\n**Question**: How can we integrate UPLC pretty-printing into our existing tooling and workflow?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Maintain consistency with existing formatting tools (treefmt)\n- Provide both manual and automatic formatting options\n- Avoid breaking existing workflows\n- Reuse existing infrastructure (plutus executable, treefmt)\n- Follow naming conventions consistent with project structure\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Manual plutus invocation only** - Document the plutus command pattern\n2. **Standalone script only** - Create a helper script without treefmt integration\n3. **Full treefmt integration** - Add UPLC formatting to treefmt with helper scripts\n4. **Custom Haskell tool** - Build a dedicated UPLC formatter in the measure-app\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: **\"Full treefmt integration\"**, because it:\n\n- Integrates seamlessly with existing `treefmt` workflow\n- Provides both manual (`pretty-uplc`) and automatic (via `treefmt`) formatting\n- Requires minimal additional tooling (reuses existing `plutus` executable)\n- Follows established patterns (similar to how fourmolu handles Haskell)\n- Consistent naming with existing script (`scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`)\n\n### Implementation Overview\n\n**Components Created:**\n\n1. **`scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`**: Standalone bash script for manual use\n   - Takes a single UPLC file path as argument\n   - Uses temporary file for safe in-place replacement\n   - Validates file existence and plutus availability\n   - Provides clear error messages and success confirmation\n\n2. **`pretty-uplc` command**: Nix shell wrapper (defined in `flake.nix`)\n   - Available after `nix develop` or `direnv reload`\n   - Provides convenient command-line interface\n   - Identical implementation to standalone script\n\n3. **treefmt integration**: Added to `treefmt.toml`\n   - Formatter: `pretty-uplc`\n   - Command: `scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`\n   - Includes: `*.uplc`\n   - Runs automatically with `treefmt`\n\n**Usage Patterns:**\n\n```bash\n# Manual single file formatting\npretty-uplc submissions/fibonacci/MyCompiler_1.0.0_handle/fibonacci.uplc\n\n# Format all files via treefmt (includes UPLC files)\ntreefmt\n\n# Direct script invocation (without nix shell command)\n./scripts/pretty-uplc.sh path/to/file.uplc\n```\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n\nThe script uses a safe temporary file pattern to avoid data loss:\n\n```bash\ntemp_file=$(mktemp)\ntrap 'rm -f \"$temp_file\"' EXIT\nplutus \"$uplc_file\" -o \"$temp_file\"\n# Ensure file ends with a newline\nif [ -s \"$temp_file\" ] && [ \"$(tail -c 1 \"$temp_file\" | wc -l)\" -eq 0 ]; then\n  echo \"\" >> \"$temp_file\"\nfi\nmv \"$temp_file\" \"$uplc_file\"\n```\n\nThis ensures:\n\n- No data loss if plutus fails\n- Automatic cleanup of temporary files\n- Atomic replacement (mv is atomic on same filesystem)\n- Files always end with a newline (POSIX standard)\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- **Consistent formatting**: All UPLC files follow the same pretty-printed format\n- **Improved readability**: Pretty-printed UPLC easier to review in PRs\n- **Automated workflow**: UPLC files formatted automatically with `treefmt`\n- **Manual control**: Can format individual files when needed\n- **Zero dependencies**: Reuses existing `plutus` executable from development environment\n- **Safe operation**: Temporary file pattern prevents data loss\n- **Clear feedback**: Success/error messages guide users\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- **Additional processing time**: treefmt now processes UPLC files (16 files currently)\n- **Requires plutus**: Only works inside nix shell (documented limitation)\n- **Line length changes**: Pretty-printing may increase file size/lines\n- **Git diffs**: Initial formatting of existing files creates large diffs\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\nUpdated the following documentation:\n\n1. **CLAUDE.md**:\n   - Added `pretty-uplc` to tools list\n   - Added UPLC formatting command reference\n   - Updated mandatory treefmt file types to include `.uplc`\n\n2. **README.md**:\n   - Added UPLC formatting section under \"Development\"\n   - Documented both manual and automatic usage\n   - Explained integration with treefmt\n\n3. **This ADR**: Documents decision rationale and implementation\n\n## Applicability\n\n**When to Use:**\n\n- Before committing UPLC files to ensure consistent formatting\n- When reviewing UPLC files for debugging\n- As part of automated CI/CD formatting checks\n- When comparing UPLC outputs from different compilers\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Only works inside nix development shell (requires `plutus` executable)\n- Formats entire file (no selective formatting)\n- Requires write access to UPLC file location\n\n## Links\n\n- [Plutus Repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus) - Source of `plutus` executable\n- [treefmt](https://treefmt.com/) - Multi-formatter orchestration tool\n- Related file: `scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`\n- Related file: `treefmt.toml`\n- Related file: `flake.nix` (pretty-uplc command definition)\n"}],["20251022-pr-preview-deployment-to-github-pages",{"title":"PR Preview Deployment to GitHub Pages","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhen reviewers evaluate pull requests that add or modify benchmark submissions, they need to see how the changes affect the generated HTML reports. Currently, reviewers must:\n\n1. Pull the PR branch locally\n2. Set up the Nix environment\n3. Run `cape submission measure --all`\n4. Run `cape submission report --all`\n5. Open the generated reports in a browser\n\nThis creates friction in the review process and makes it harder to spot performance regressions or improvements.\n\n**Question**: How can we provide automatic, isolated preview sites for PRs that modify submission data?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- **Visual feedback**: Reviewers need to see report changes without local setup\n- **Isolation**: Multiple PRs should have separate previews without conflicts\n- **Automation**: Previews should update automatically on push\n- **Cleanup**: Remove previews when PRs close to avoid clutter\n- **Efficiency**: Only generate reports when submission data actually changes\n- **Compatibility**: Coexist with existing `static.yml` workflow for main branch\n\n## Considered Options\n\n### 1. Official GitHub Pages Actions (actions/deploy-pages)\n\n**Approach**: Use the official `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and `actions/deploy-pages` actions.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Official GitHub solution\n- Well-maintained and documented\n- Already used in `static.yml`\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Deploys to root of GitHub Pages site (replaces entire site)\n- Cannot deploy to subdirectories\n- Would conflict with main branch deployments\n- Each deployment overwrites previous content\n\n**Verdict**: ❌ Not suitable for PR previews due to lack of subdirectory support\n\n### 2. Git-based Deployment with peaceiris/actions-gh-pages\n\n**Approach**: Push report content directly to the `gh-pages` branch under PR-specific subdirectories.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Supports `destination_dir` for subdirectory deployments\n- `keep_files: true` preserves other PR previews\n- Compatible with existing main branch deployment\n- Widely used and battle-tested action\n- Automatic conflict resolution\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Slightly more complex than official actions\n- Direct git operations on gh-pages branch\n\n**Verdict**: ✅ Chosen solution\n\n### 3.

Checkout PR branch with full history (`fetch-depth: 0`)\n2. Check if submission data files actually changed:\n   ```bash\n   git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -qE 'submissions/.*\\.(uplc|metadata\\.json)$'\n   ```\n3. If no data changes: Skip remaining steps (optimization)\n4. If data changed:\n   - Set up Nix environment with Cachix\n   - Build `measure` executable\n   - Run `cape submission measure --all`\n   - Run `cape submission report --all`\n   - Deploy to `gh-pages` under `pr-<number>/` subdirectory\n   - Post sticky comment with preview URL\n\n**Deployment Configuration**:\n\n```yaml\nuses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4\nwith:\n  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  publish_dir: ./report\n  destination_dir: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n  keep_files: true\n```\n\n**Comment Integration**:\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  header: pr-preview\n  message: |\n    ## 🚀 PR Preview Deployed\n    Preview URL: https://intersectmbo.github.io/UPLC-CAPE/pr-<number>/\n```\n\n#### 2.
