Multi-View Approach for Benchmark Scenario Specification","verbatim":"\nTechnical Story: Refactor the monolithic fibonacci benchmark template by extracting individual files for different view types (state machine, behavioral scenarios, implementation logic).\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nThe initial fibonacci benchmark scenario was specified as a single monolithic document that mixed different types of specification concerns: lifecycle visualization, behavioral test cases, and algorithmic implementation details. This approach created several issues:\n\n1. **Cognitive overload**: Developers had to parse through different types of information to find what they needed\n2. **Maintenance complexity**: Changes to one aspect (e.g., test scenarios) required editing a large document containing unrelated concerns\n3. **Poor reusability**: Different stakeholders needed different views but had to consume the entire specification\n4. **Inconsistent abstraction levels**: The document mixed high-level state transitions with low-level implementation details\n\nHow can we structure benchmark scenario specifications to be more maintainable, consumable, and aligned with best practices for smart contract specification?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Need for clear separation of concerns in specification documents\n- Research findings advocating for multi-view specification approaches for smart contracts\n- Desire to make scenarios argument-agnostic and reusable across different test cases\n- Goal to improve maintainability and reduce cognitive load for different stakeholder groups\n- Alignment with established software engineering practices for specification documentation\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Single monolithic document** (current approach)\n2. **Multi-view approach with three distinct views**\n3. **Fully formal specification using mathematical notation**\n4. **Code-first approach with minimal documentation**\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Multi-view approach with three distinct views\", because it directly addresses the identified problems while following research-backed best practices for smart contract specification.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- **Improved maintainability**: Each view can be updated independently without affecting others\n- **Better stakeholder alignment**: Different roles can focus on their relevant view (auditors on behavioral scenarios, implementers on logic view, etc.)\n- **Enhanced reusability**: Views are argument-agnostic and can be applied to different test cases\n- **Clearer documentation structure**: Each view has a specific purpose and abstraction level\n- **Reduced cognitive load**: Stakeholders can consume only the information relevant to their needs\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- **Increased file count**: Three files instead of one per scenario\n- **Cross-reference complexity**: Need to maintain consistency across multiple views\n- **Initial learning curve**: Contributors need to understand the multi-view approach\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Single monolithic document\n\nCurrent approach where all specification aspects are in one file.\n\n- Good, because simple file structure with everything in one place\n- Good, because no cross-reference management needed\n- Bad, because creates cognitive overload for readers\n- Bad, because difficult to maintain as scenarios grow in complexity\n- Bad, because mixes different abstraction levels inappropriately\n\n### Multi-view approach with three distinct views\n\nThree separate files: state machine view, behavioral scenarios view, and implementation logic view.\n\n- Good, because aligns with established specification practices for smart contract development\n- Good, because provides clear separation of concerns\n- Good, because enables stakeholder-specific consumption\n- Good, because improves maintainability through modular structure\n- Good, because makes scenarios argument-agnostic and more reusable\n- Bad, because increases file count and cross-reference complexity\n- Bad, because requires initial learning investment for contributors\n\n### Fully formal specification using mathematical notation\n\nMathematical specification using formal methods notation.\n\n- Good, because provides unambiguous specification\n- Good, because enables formal verification\n- Bad, because requires specialized knowledge to read and write\n- Bad, because not accessible to most smart contract developers\n- Bad, because overkill for benchmark scenario specification\n\n### Code-first approach with minimal documentation\n\nMinimal documentation with primary specification in reference implementations.\n\n- Good, because executable specification that can't drift from implementation\n- Good, because familiar to developers\n- Bad, because ties specification to specific programming languages\n- Bad, because makes cross-compiler comparison more difficult\n- Bad, because reduces accessibility for non-implementers (auditors, stakeholders)\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe multi-view approach consists of three distinct files per scenario:\n\n### 1. State Machine View (`*-state-machine.md`)\n\n- **Purpose**: High-level lifecycle visualization\n- **Content**: Mermaid state diagrams embedded in markdown, state descriptions, transition conditions\n- **Audience**: All stakeholders seeking high-level understanding\n\n### 2.

The mode system added unnecessary complexity; the scenario-based approach achieves the same goals more simply.\n\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nUPLC-CAPE users have two distinct benchmarking needs that are sometimes in conflict:\n\n1. **Compiler Comparison** (Group A): Users want to compare compiler optimization effectiveness in isolation by having all submissions implement the **same algorithm**. This provides apples-to-apples comparison where performance differences reflect compiler capabilities rather than algorithmic choices.\n\n2. **Real-World Competition** (Group B): Users want submissions to showcase ecosystem capabilities using **any optimizations or algorithms** (memoization, metaprogramming, different algorithms). This reflects practical deployment strategies and compiler USPs.\n\nCurrently, the framework allows any implementation approach, but all submissions compete in a single pool. This makes it impossible to isolate compiler effectiveness from algorithmic choices, frustrating both user groups.\n\n**Question**: How can we support both pure compiler comparison and open optimization competition within the same framework?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Must satisfy both user groups without forcing them into a single evaluation mode\n- Should enable multiple optimization experiments per compiler/author\n- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing submissions\n- Should provide clear, self-documenting organization\n- Must be intuitive for new users while supporting advanced workflows\n- Should facilitate both academic research and practical developer guidance\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Separate Scenario Types** -

After implementation and community feedback, several issues were identified:\n\n**Problems with the Mode System:**\n\n1. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The mode attribute added an extra dimension to track across metadata, CLI flags, directory naming, and reporting\n2. **Verbose Documentation**: Scenario docs grew to 221-230 lines, including extensive mode-specific guidance that overwhelmed implementors\n3. **Confusing Reporting**: HTML reports separated base/open modes within the same scenario, creating cognitive overhead\n4. **Unclear Semantics**: The concept of \"modes\" within a single scenario was less intuitive than having separate scenarios\n\n**Feedback Summary:**\n\n- \"The 'mode' as implemented adds too much complexity\"\n- \"Scenario descriptions are too verbose for implementors\"\n- \"Common submission instructions should be extracted\"\n- \"Instead of mode=base, we should have dedicated scenarios like `fibonacci_naive_recursion`\"\n\n**Question**: How can we achieve the same goal (prescribed vs. open optimization benchmarks) with less complexity and better clarity?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Reduce cognitive overhead for users (implementors and report readers)\n- Simplify metadata schema and CLI interface\n- Make scenario intent immediately clear from directory structure\n- Extract common guidance to avoid duplication\n- Maintain backward compatibility path for existing submissions\n- Enable future growth with additional constraint variations\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Keep Mode System** - Retain base/open modes with incremental improvements\n2. **Scenario-Based Approach** - Create dedicated scenarios for prescribed algorithms\n3. **Tag-Based System** - Use metadata tags instead of mode field\n4. **Hybrid Approach** - Combine scenarios with optional mode flags\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: **\"Scenario-Based Approach\"**, because it:\n\n- Eliminates the mode attribute entirely (simpler metadata and CLI)\n- Makes intent immediately clear from scenario name (`fibonacci` vs `fibonacci_naive_recursion`)\n- Reduces scenario documentation by 70-80% (from ~220 lines to ~40-60 lines)\n- Enables natural growth (can add `fibonacci_iterative`, `fibonacci_memoized`, etc. as separate scenarios)\n- Simplifies HTML reports (back to simple scenario-based organization)\n- Follows principle of \"make the common case simple\" (most users want either prescribed OR open, rarely both)\n\n### Implementation Overview\n\n**New Scenario Structure:**\n\n```\nscenarios/\n├── fibonacci/                    #

variant in name\ncape submission list fibonacci_naive_recursion\ncape submission report fibonacci\n```\n\n**HTML Report Restoration:**\n\n- Return to pre-mode format: single table per scenario\n- `fibonacci` and `fibonacci_naive_recursion` are independent scenarios with separate reports\n- No mode filtering or grouping logic\n- Simpler, more predictable navigation\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- **70-80% reduction in scenario doc length**: From 221-230 lines to 40-60 lines\n- **Eliminated CLI complexity**: No `--mode` or `--slug` flags to remember\n- **Clearer intent**: Scenario name immediately indicates constraints\n- **Simpler metadata**: Fewer required fields, less validation complexity\n- **Better organization**: Common guidance in single location (`doc/submission-guide.md`)\n- **Natural extensibility**: Easy to add `fibonacci_iterative`, `factorial_tail_recursive`, etc.\n- **Simpler reports**: Back to straightforward scenario-based tables\n- **Lower maintenance**: Less code to maintain (no mode filtering throughout)\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- **Breaking change**: Requires migration of existing submissions\n- **More scenario directories**: `fibonacci_naive_recursion` adds directory (but clearer)\n- **Potential proliferation**: Could lead to many scenario variants (but this is actually a feature for fine-grained benchmarking)\n- **Migration effort**: All existing metadata.json files must be updated\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Option 1: Keep Mode System\n\n- Good, because no migration needed\n- Good, because mode concept is familiar from compilation contexts\n- Bad, because adds complexity to metadata, CLI, and reports\n- Bad, because scenario docs remain too long (220+ lines)\n- Bad, because mode semantics less clear than scenario names\n- Bad, because feedback indicates it's \"too much complexity\"\n\n### Option 2: Scenario-Based Approach (CHOSEN)\n\n- Good, because scenario name immediately indicates intent\n- Good, because massive documentation simplification (70-80% reduction)\n- Good, because eliminates mode attribute entirely\n- Good, because simpler CLI and metadata schema\n- Good, because enables natural growth (add scenarios as needed)\n- Good, because addresses all feedback points\n- Bad, because requires migration of existing submissions\n- Bad, because creates more top-level scenario directories\n\n### Option 3: Tag-Based System\n\n- Good, because flexible tagging without directory changes\n- Bad, because tags hidden in metadata (less discoverable)\n- Bad, because doesn't solve documentation verbosity\n- Bad, because still requires attribute in metadata\n- Bad, because unclear semantics (what tags mean what?)\n\n### Option 4: Hybrid Approach\n\n- Good, because could combine benefits\n- Bad, because adds even more complexity\n- Bad, because doesn't address core feedback about simplification\n- Bad, because would still have verbose documentation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Scenario Creation\n\nNew scenarios created with prescribed algorithms:\n\n- `scenarios/fibonacci_naive_recursion/` - Naive recursive fibonacci implementation required\n- `scenarios/factorial_naive_recursion/` - Naive recursive factorial implementation required\n\nEach includes:\n\n- Streamlined `.md` spec (~40-60 lines)\n- `cape-tests.json` for verification\n- Same structure as existing scenarios\n\n### Documentation Extraction\n\nCreate `doc/submission-guide.md` containing:\n\n- **Metrics Explanation**: What CPU units, memory units, script size, term size mean\n- **Acceptance Criteria**: Correctness, budget compliance, determinism, self-contained, valid format\n- **Validation Workflow**: Commands to verify and measure submissions\n- **File Requirements**: What files are needed (uplc, metadata.json, metrics.json, README.md)\n- **Templates**: Links to schema and template files\n- **Common Checklist**: Steps all submissions should follow\n\nAll scenario docs link to this guide instead of duplicating content.\n\n### Migration Strategy\n\n**Existing Submissions:**\n\n1. Create new scenario directories:\n   - `submissions/fibonacci_naive_recursion/`\n   - `submissions/factorial_naive_recursion/`\n\n2. Migrate base mode submissions:\n   - `fibonacci/*_base/` → `fibonacci_naive_recursion/*/` (remove `_base` suffix)\n   - `factorial/*_base/` → `factorial_naive_recursion/*/` (remove `_base` suffix)\n\n3. Migrate open mode submissions:\n   - `fibonacci/*_open/` → `fibonacci/*/` (remove `_open` suffix)\n   - `factorial/*_open/` → `factorial/*/` (remove `_open` suffix)\n   - `factorial/*_open_pfix/` → `factorial/*_pfix/` (remove `_open_`, keep variant)\n\n4. Update all `metadata.json` files:\n   - Remove `\"mode\": \"base|open\"` field\n   - Remove `\"slug\": \"...\"` field (if present)\n\n**CLI Updates:**\n\nRemove from all affected scripts:\n\n- `--mode base|open` flag and associated logic\n- `--slug <name>` flag and associated logic\n- Mode-based filtering in list/report/aggregate commands\n- Mode-based directory naming logic\n\n**Schema Updates:**\n\nRemove from `submissions/TEMPLATE/metadata.schema.json`:\n\n- `submission.mode` field (was required)\n- `submission.slug` field (was optional)\n\nUpdate `metadata-template.json` accordingly.\n\n**Report Generation:**\n\nRestore pre-mode report format:\n\n- Remove mode filtering/grouping\n- Each scenario gets its own independent report\n- `fibonacci` and `fibonacci_naive_recursion` treated as separate scenarios\n- Simple scenario-based navigation\n\n### Verification Strategy\n\n**Scenario Compliance:**\n\nFor prescribed scenarios (`_naive_recursion`):\n\n- Community review during PR process\n- Submission README explains algorithm compliance\n- Reviewers verify against scenario specification\n- Honor system with clear guidelines\n\nFor open scenarios:\n\n- No algorithmic constraints\n- Only correctness verification via `cape-tests.json`\n- Variant suffix (e.g., `_memoized`) for documentation only\n\n## Applicability\n\n**When to Use Prescribed Scenarios:**\n\n- Synthetic benchmarks where algorithm can be clearly specified\n- Compiler comparison needs (isolate compiler effectiveness)\n- Educational purposes (demonstrate optimization of specific algorithm)\n\n**When to Use Open Scenarios:**\n\n- Real-world scenarios (complex validators)\n- Optimization showcases (best achievable performance)\n- Exploring different algorithmic approaches\n\n**Growth Pattern:**\n\n- Start with open scenario (e.g., `fibonacci`)\n- Add prescribed variants as needed (e.g., `fibonacci_naive_recursion`, `fibonacci_iterative`)\n- Each scenario is self-contained and independently useful\n\n## Migration Timeline\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Create new scenarios and documentation (fibonacci_naive_recursion, factorial_naive_recursion, submission-guide.md)\n2. **Phase 2**: Remove mode system from CLI and schemas\n3. **Phase 3**: Migrate existing submissions\n4. **Phase 4**: Restore HTML report format\n5. **Phase 5**: Update tests and project documentation\n6. **Phase 6**: Final verification and testing\n\nEstimated total effort: 20-26 hours\n\n## Links\n\n- [GitHub Issue #59](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/UPLC-CAPE/issues/59) - Original feature request for base/open mode system\n- [GitHub PR #60](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/UPLC-CAPE/pull/60) - Implementation of mode system (now superseded)\n- Supersedes: <AdrLink slug=\"20251006-baseopen-mode-system-with-submission-slugs\" status=\"superseded\" title=\"Base/Open Mode System with Submission Slugs\" customLabel=\"ADR 20251006: Base/Open Mode System\" />\n"}],["20251017-uplc-pretty-printing-integration",{"title":"UPLC Pretty-Printing Integration","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nUPLC files (`.uplc`) in the repository are often minified or inconsistently formatted, making them difficult to review, compare, and debug. The `plutus` executable from the Plutus repository provides pretty-printing capabilities via its output flag (`-o`), but there was no convenient way to:\n\n1. Pretty-print UPLC files in place\n2. Automatically format UPLC files as part of the development workflow\n3. Ensure consistent formatting across all submissions\n\n**Question**: How can we integrate UPLC pretty-printing into our existing tooling and workflow?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Maintain consistency with existing formatting tools (treefmt)\n- Provide both manual and automatic formatting options\n- Avoid breaking existing workflows\n- Reuse existing infrastructure (plutus executable, treefmt)\n- Follow naming conventions consistent with project structure\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **Manual plutus invocation only** - Document the plutus command pattern\n2. **Standalone script only** - Create a helper script without treefmt integration\n3. **Full treefmt integration** - Add UPLC formatting to treefmt with helper scripts\n4. **Custom Haskell tool** - Build a dedicated UPLC formatter in the measure-app\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: **\"Full treefmt integration\"**, because it:\n\n- Integrates seamlessly with existing `treefmt` workflow\n- Provides both manual (`pretty-uplc`) and automatic (via `treefmt`) formatting\n- Requires minimal additional tooling (reuses existing `plutus` executable)\n- Follows established patterns (similar to how fourmolu handles Haskell)\n- Consistent naming with existing script (`scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`)\n\n### Implementation Overview\n\n**Components Created:**\n\n1. **`scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`**: Standalone bash script for manual use\n   - Takes a single UPLC file path as argument\n   - Uses temporary file for safe in-place replacement\n   - Validates file existence and plutus availability\n   - Provides clear error messages and success confirmation\n\n2. **`pretty-uplc` command**: Nix shell wrapper (defined in `flake.nix`)\n   - Available after `nix develop` or `direnv reload`\n   - Provides convenient command-line interface\n   - Identical implementation to standalone script\n\n3. **treefmt integration**: Added to `treefmt.toml`\n   - Formatter: `pretty-uplc`\n   - Command: `scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`\n   - Includes: `*.uplc`\n   - Runs automatically with `treefmt`\n\n**Usage Patterns:**\n\n```bash\n# Manual single file formatting\npretty-uplc submissions/fibonacci/MyCompiler_1.0.0_handle/fibonacci.uplc\n\n# Format all files via treefmt (includes UPLC files)\ntreefmt\n\n# Direct script invocation (without nix shell command)\n./scripts/pretty-uplc.sh path/to/file.uplc\n```\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n\nThe script uses a safe temporary file pattern to avoid data loss:\n\n```bash\ntemp_file=$(mktemp)\ntrap 'rm -f \"$temp_file\"' EXIT\nplutus \"$uplc_file\" -o \"$temp_file\"\n# Ensure file ends with a newline\nif [ -s \"$temp_file\" ] && [ \"$(tail -c 1 \"$temp_file\" | wc -l)\" -eq 0 ]; then\n  echo \"\" >> \"$temp_file\"\nfi\nmv \"$temp_file\" \"$uplc_file\"\n```\n\nThis ensures:\n\n- No data loss if plutus fails\n- Automatic cleanup of temporary files\n- Atomic replacement (mv is atomic on same filesystem)\n- Files always end with a newline (POSIX standard)\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- **Consistent formatting**: All UPLC files follow the same pretty-printed format\n- **Improved readability**: Pretty-printed UPLC easier to review in PRs\n- **Automated workflow**: UPLC files formatted automatically with `treefmt`\n- **Manual control**: Can format individual files when needed\n- **Zero dependencies**: Reuses existing `plutus` executable from development environment\n- **Safe operation**: Temporary file pattern prevents data loss\n- **Clear feedback**: Success/error messages guide users\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- **Additional processing time**: treefmt now processes UPLC files (16 files currently)\n- **Requires plutus**: Only works inside nix shell (documented limitation)\n- **Line length changes**: Pretty-printing may increase file size/lines\n- **Git diffs**: Initial formatting of existing files creates large diffs\n\n## Documentation Updates\n\nUpdated the following documentation:\n\n1. **CLAUDE.md**:\n   - Added `pretty-uplc` to tools list\n   - Added UPLC formatting command reference\n   - Updated mandatory treefmt file types to include `.uplc`\n\n2. **README.md**:\n   - Added UPLC formatting section under \"Development\"\n   - Documented both manual and automatic usage\n   - Explained integration with treefmt\n\n3. **This ADR**: Documents decision rationale and implementation\n\n## Applicability\n\n**When to Use:**\n\n- Before committing UPLC files to ensure consistent formatting\n- When reviewing UPLC files for debugging\n- As part of automated CI/CD formatting checks\n- When comparing UPLC outputs from different compilers\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n- Only works inside nix development shell (requires `plutus` executable)\n- Formats entire file (no selective formatting)\n- Requires write access to UPLC file location\n\n## Links\n\n- [Plutus Repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus) - Source of `plutus` executable\n- [treefmt](https://treefmt.com/) - Multi-formatter orchestration tool\n- Related file: `scripts/pretty-uplc.sh`\n- Related file: `treefmt.toml`\n- Related file: `flake.nix` (pretty-uplc command definition)\n"}],["20251022-pr-preview-deployment-to-github-pages",{"title":"PR Preview Deployment to GitHub Pages","verbatim":"\n## Context and Problem Statement\n\nWhen reviewers evaluate pull requests that add or modify benchmark submissions, they need to see how the changes affect the generated HTML reports.

Official GitHub Pages Actions (actions/deploy-pages)\n\n**Approach**: Use the official `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and `actions/deploy-pages` actions.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Official GitHub solution\n- Well-maintained and documented\n- Already used in `static.yml`\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Deploys to root of GitHub Pages site (replaces entire site)\n- Cannot deploy to subdirectories\n- Would conflict with main branch deployments\n- Each deployment overwrites previous content\n\n**Verdict**: ❌ Not suitable for PR previews due to lack of subdirectory support\n\n### 2. Git-based Deployment with peaceiris/actions-gh-pages\n\n**Approach**: Push report content directly to the `gh-pages` branch under PR-specific subdirectories.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Supports `destination_dir` for subdirectory deployments\n- `keep_files: true` preserves other PR previews\n- Compatible with existing main branch deployment\n- Widely used and battle-tested action\n- Automatic conflict resolution\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Slightly more complex than official actions\n- Direct git operations on gh-pages branch\n\n**Verdict**: ✅ Chosen solution\n\n### 3.

Checkout PR branch with full history (`fetch-depth: 0`)\n2. Check if submission data files actually changed:\n   ```bash\n   git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -qE 'submissions/.*\\.(uplc|metadata\\.json)$'\n   ```\n3. If no data changes: Skip remaining steps (optimization)\n4. If data changed:\n   - Set up Nix environment with Cachix\n   - Build `measure` executable\n   - Run `cape submission measure --all`\n   - Run `cape submission report --all`\n   - Deploy to `gh-pages` under `pr-<number>/` subdirectory\n   - Post sticky comment with preview URL\n\n**Deployment Configuration**:\n\n```yaml\nuses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4\nwith:\n  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n  publish_dir: ./report\n  destination_dir: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\n  keep_files: true\n```\n\n**Comment Integration**:\n\n```yaml\nuses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2\nwith:\n  header: pr-preview\n  message: |\n    ## 🚀 PR Preview Deployed\n    Preview URL: https://intersectmbo.github.io/UPLC-CAPE/pr-<number>/\n```\n\n#### 2.

Scenarios need an explicit categorization mechanism that works for all cases (e.g., `ecd` is a fixed algorithm scenario, while `fibonacci` is open optimization).\n\n**Question**: How should scenarios be categorized in a way that is explicit, maintainable, and supports the reporting system's need to separate fixed vs open scenarios?\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Need explicit, declarative categorization that doesn't rely on implicit naming patterns\n- Must be easy for scenario authors to specify and understand\n- Should be maintainable and validate-able\n- Must support the HTML report generation system\n- Should be embedded in scenario specification (single source of truth)\n- Must provide clear error messages when misconfigured\n\n## Considered Options\n\n1. **YAML Frontmatter Metadata** - Add `category` attribute to scenario markdown files\n2. **Separate Metadata File** - Create `metadata.json` alongside scenario specification\n3. **Directory Structure** - Use subdirectories like `scenarios/fixed/` and `scenarios/open/`\n4. **Naming Convention** - Use suffixes like `_naive_recursion` to infer category\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: **\"YAML Frontmatter Metadata\"**, because it provides the best balance of explicitness, maintainability, and integration with existing documentation structure.\n\n### Implementation\n\nAdd YAML frontmatter to the beginning of each scenario specification file (`scenarios/{name}/{name}.md`):\n\n```yaml\n---\ncategory: fixed # or \"open\"\n---\n```\n\n**Category Values**:\n\n- `fixed`: Fixed algorithm scenarios requiring prescribed implementation (e.g., `ecd`, `factorial_naive_recursion`, `fibonacci_naive_recursion`)\n- `open`: Open optimization scenarios allowing any approach (e.g., `factorial`, `fibonacci`, `two_party_escrow`)\n\n**Extraction Method**: The `categorize_scenario()` function in `report.sh` extracts the category using AWK:\n\n```bash\ncategory=$(awk 'BEGIN{in_fm=0} /^---$/ {in_fm++; next} in_fm==1 && /^category:/ {print $2; exit}' \"$scenario_file\")\n```\n\n**Error Handling**:\n\n- If scenario file is missing: Error with clear message\n- If category attribute is missing: Error with instructions to add frontmatter\n- If category value is invalid (not \"fixed\" or \"open\"): Error with valid values\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- ✅ Explicit categorization visible at the top of scenario specification\n- ✅ Single source of truth (embedded in the spec that defines the scenario)\n- ✅ Easy for scenario authors to understand and specify\n- ✅ Self-documenting (category is part of the specification)\n- ✅ Supports validation and error checking\n- ✅ No additional files or complex directory restructuring required\n- ✅ Standard YAML format familiar to developers\n- ✅ Clear error messages guide users to fix issues\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Requires updating all existing scenario files to add frontmatter\n- Adds a small amount of boilerplate to scenario specifications\n- Requires parsing YAML frontmatter in bash scripts (using AWK)\n\n## Pros and Cons of the Options\n\n### Option 1: YAML Frontmatter Metadata (CHOSEN)\n\n- Good, because it's explicit and declarative\n- Good, because it's embedded in the scenario specification (single source of truth)\n- Good, because YAML frontmatter is a standard pattern in documentation\n- Good, because it's self-documenting\n- Good, because it supports validation\n- Bad, because it requires updating existing files\n- Bad, because it adds boilerplate to scenario specs\n\n### Option 2: Separate Metadata File\n\n- Good, because it separates concerns (spec vs metadata)\n- Good, because it could support more extensive metadata\n- Bad, because it creates multiple files to maintain per scenario\n- Bad, because it fragments the source of truth\n- Bad, because scenario authors must remember to update both files\n\n### Option 3: Directory Structure\n\n- Good, because categorization is visible in file paths\n- Bad, because it requires major directory restructuring\n- Bad, because it complicates scenario naming and references\n- Bad, because moving scenarios between categories is harder\n\n### Option 4: Naming Convention\n\n- Good, because no additional files or metadata required\n- Good, because categorization is visible in the scenario name\n- Bad, because it's implicit and error-prone\n- Bad, because it doesn't cover all cases (e.g., `ecd` doesn't have a distinguishing suffix)\n- Bad, because it couples scenario naming to categorization logic\n- Bad, because scenarios might not follow the pattern consistently\n\n## Migration\n\nAll existing scenario files were updated to include category frontmatter:\n\n**Fixed algorithm scenarios**:\n\n- `scenarios/ecd/ecd.md`: `category: fixed`\n- `scenarios/factorial_naive_recursion/factorial_naive_recursion.md`: `category: fixed`\n- `scenarios/fibonacci_naive_recursion/fibonacci_naive_recursion.md`: `category: fixed`\n\n**Open optimization scenarios**:\n\n- `scenarios/factorial/factorial.md`: `category: open`\n- `scenarios/fibonacci/fibonacci.md`: `category: open`\n- `scenarios/two_party_escrow/two_party_escrow.md`: `category: open`\n\n## Links\n\n- [Issue #137: Improve HTML report landing page](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/UPLC-CAPE/issues/137)\n- Related: <AdrLink slug=\"20251009-scenario-based-approach-replacing-mode-system\" status=\"accepted\" title=\"Scenario-Based Approach: Replacing Mode System with Dedicated Scenarios\" customLabel=\"ADR 20251009: Scenario-Based Approach\" /> - Defines fixed vs open scenarios\n"}]]}
