# PR Preview Deployment to GitHub Pages

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2025-10-22
- Tags: ci-cd, github-actions, deployment, developer-experience

## Context and Problem Statement

When reviewers evaluate pull requests that add or modify benchmark submissions, they need to see how the changes affect the generated HTML reports. Currently, reviewers must:

1. Pull the PR branch locally
2. Set up the Nix environment
3. Run `cape submission measure --all`
4. Run `cape submission report --all`
5. Open the generated reports in a browser

This creates friction in the review process and makes it harder to spot performance regressions or improvements.

**Question**: How can we provide automatic, isolated preview sites for PRs that modify submission data?

## Decision Drivers

- **Visual feedback**: Reviewers need to see report changes without local setup
- **Isolation**: Multiple PRs should have separate previews without conflicts
- **Automation**: Previews should update automatically on push
- **Cleanup**: Remove previews when PRs close to avoid clutter
- **Efficiency**: Only generate reports when submission data actually changes
- **Compatibility**: Coexist with existing `static.yml` workflow for main branch

## Considered Options

### 1. Official GitHub Pages Actions (actions/deploy-pages)

**Approach**: Use the official `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and `actions/deploy-pages` actions.

**Pros**:

- Official GitHub solution
- Well-maintained and documented
- Already used in `static.yml`

**Cons**:

- Deploys to root of GitHub Pages site (replaces entire site)
- Cannot deploy to subdirectories
- Would conflict with main branch deployments
- Each deployment overwrites previous content

**Verdict**: ‚ùå Not suitable for PR previews due to lack of subdirectory support

### 2. Git-based Deployment with peaceiris/actions-gh-pages

**Approach**: Push report content directly to the `gh-pages` branch under PR-specific subdirectories.

**Pros**:

- Supports `destination_dir` for subdirectory deployments
- `keep_files: true` preserves other PR previews
- Compatible with existing main branch deployment
- Widely used and battle-tested action
- Automatic conflict resolution

**Cons**:

- Slightly more complex than official actions
- Direct git operations on gh-pages branch

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ Chosen solution

### 3. Netlify/Vercel Preview Deployments

**Approach**: Use external preview deployment services.

**Pros**:

- Purpose-built for preview deployments
- Advanced features (custom domains, redirects)

**Cons**:

- Requires third-party service setup
- Additional authentication/secrets management
- Project already uses GitHub Pages
- Adds external dependency

**Verdict**: ‚ùå Unnecessary complexity

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Git-based Deployment with peaceiris/actions-gh-pages"**, because it:

- Enables subdirectory deployments (`pr-<number>/`)
- Preserves existing previews and main branch site
- Integrates seamlessly with existing GitHub Pages setup
- Provides automatic cleanup workflow
- Requires no additional external services

### Implementation Overview

**Two GitHub Actions workflows:**

#### 1. PR Preview Workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-preview.yml`)

**Triggers**:

- Pull request opened, synchronized, or reopened
- **Path filter**: Only runs when `submissions/**` changes

**Optimization Strategy (Hybrid Approach)**:

1. **Coarse-grained filter**: `paths: submissions/**` prevents workflow execution for non-submission PRs
2. **Fine-grained validation**: Git diff checks if `.uplc` or `metadata.json` files changed
3. **Early exit**: Skips report generation if only documentation/README changed

**Key Steps**:

1. Checkout PR branch with full history (`fetch-depth: 0`)
2. Check if submission data files actually changed:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -qE 'submissions/.*\.(uplc|metadata\.json)$'
   ```
3. If no data changes: Skip remaining steps (optimization)
4. If data changed:
   - Set up Nix environment with Cachix
   - Build `measure` executable
   - Run `cape submission measure --all`
   - Run `cape submission report --all`
   - Deploy to `gh-pages` under `pr-<number>/` subdirectory
   - Post sticky comment with preview URL

**Deployment Configuration**:

```yaml
uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4
with:
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  publish_dir: ./report
  destination_dir: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  keep_files: true
```

**Comment Integration**:

```yaml
uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
with:
  header: pr-preview
  message: |
    ## üöÄ PR Preview Deployed
    Preview URL: https://intersectmbo.github.io/UPLC-CAPE/pr-<number>/
```

#### 2. Cleanup Workflow (`.github/workflows/cleanup-preview.yml`)

**Triggers**:

- Pull request closed (merged or abandoned)

**Key Steps**:

1. Checkout `gh-pages` branch
2. Remove `pr-<number>/` directory if exists
3. Commit and push changes

**Idempotency**: Safely handles cases where preview directory doesn't exist.

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: pr-preview-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

- Prevents multiple simultaneous deployments for the same PR
- Cancels in-progress runs when new commits are pushed

### Preview URL Pattern

```
https://intersectmbo.github.io/UPLC-CAPE/pr-<number>/
```

**Examples**:

- PR #42: `https://intersectmbo.github.io/UPLC-CAPE/pr-42/`
- PR #110: `https://intersectmbo.github.io/UPLC-CAPE/pr-110/`

### Coexistence with Main Branch Deployment

- **Main branch** (`static.yml`): Deploys to root using `actions/deploy-pages`
- **PR branches** (`pr-preview.yml`): Deploy to subdirectories using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`
- **No conflicts**: Different deployment mechanisms target different locations

## Positive Consequences

- **Improved review workflow**: Reviewers see visual changes immediately
- **No local setup required**: Preview sites accessible from any browser
- **Isolated environments**: Each PR has independent preview
- **Automatic updates**: Previews refresh on every push
- **Automatic cleanup**: No manual intervention needed when PRs close
- **Resource efficiency**: Only generates reports when submission data changes
- **Smart filtering**: Avoids unnecessary CI runs for documentation-only changes
- **Sticky comments**: Preview link stays at top of PR conversation
- **Zero configuration**: Uses default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no secrets needed

## Negative Consequences

- **CI resource usage**: Measuring and reporting adds ~5-10 minutes per PR
  - Mitigated by: Path filters and git diff checks
- **gh-pages branch growth**: Each PR adds a subdirectory
  - Mitigated by: Automatic cleanup on PR close
- **Preview URL lifetime**: Links become invalid after PR closes
  - Acceptable: Previews are temporary by design
- **Concurrent PR limitations**: Many simultaneous PRs could create many subdirectories
  - Acceptable: Cleanup workflow keeps it manageable

## Hybrid Optimization Strategy

The implementation uses a two-layer filtering approach:

### Layer 1: GitHub Paths Filter (Workflow Execution Gate)

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "submissions/**"
```

**Effect**: Prevents workflow from running for PRs that don't touch `submissions/` at all.

**Catches**:

- Documentation changes in root
- Code changes in `lib/`, `measure-app/`, etc.
- CI/CD configuration changes

### Layer 2: Git Diff Validation (Report Generation Gate)

```bash
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -qE 'submissions/.*\.(uplc|metadata\.json)$'
```

**Effect**: Skips report generation if only non-data files changed in `submissions/`.

**Catches**:

- README updates in submission directories
- Documentation improvements in `source/` directories
- Comment changes in metadata

### Combined Efficiency

**Scenario 1**: PR modifies `lib/Cape/Compile.hs`

- ‚úÖ Layer 1 blocks ‚Üí Workflow doesn't run at all

**Scenario 2**: PR updates `submissions/fibonacci/Plinth_1.0.0_baseline/README.md`

- ‚ùå Layer 1 allows ‚Üí Workflow starts
- ‚úÖ Layer 2 blocks ‚Üí Early exit, no report generation

**Scenario 3**: PR adds new `submissions/fibonacci/MyCompiler_2.0.0_handle/fibonacci.uplc`

- ‚ùå Layer 1 allows ‚Üí Workflow starts
- ‚ùå Layer 2 allows ‚Üí Full report generation and deployment

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Single-Layer Filtering

**Option A**: Only use paths filter

- Simpler configuration
- Wastes CI resources on README-only changes

**Option B**: Only use git diff check

- Workflow runs for all PRs
- Adds unnecessary setup overhead

**Decision**: Hybrid approach provides best balance of simplicity and efficiency.

## Documentation Updates

### README.md

Expanded **"Live Performance Reports"** section to include:

- New subsection on PR Preview Sites
- Preview URL pattern explanation
- Trigger conditions (submission data changes)
- Automatic update and cleanup behavior
- Reference to this ADR

### USAGE.md

Added brief note about:

- PR preview functionality
- When previews are generated
- Reference to README.md for details

## Testing Considerations

**Manual Testing**:

1. Create PR with submission changes ‚Üí Verify preview deploys
2. Push additional commits ‚Üí Verify preview updates
3. Create PR with only README changes ‚Üí Verify no deployment
4. Close PR ‚Üí Verify cleanup removes directory

**Validation Points**:

- Preview URL returns 200 status
- Report content reflects PR branch data
- Sticky comment appears on PR
- Preview directory removed after close
