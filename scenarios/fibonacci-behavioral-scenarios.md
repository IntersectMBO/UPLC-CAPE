# Fibonacci Algorithm - Behavioral Scenarios

This view defines the behavioral scenarios for testing the Fibonacci algorithm using Gherkin syntax.

## Feature: Fibonacci Computation

To compute a Fibonacci number efficiently while measuring performance characteristics.

### Scenario: Standard Fibonacci Computation

```gherkin
Given a Fibonacci function is compiled and ready for execution
And the function will be fully-applied with a target value
When the function is executed on the CEK machine with the target argument
Then the computation should complete successfully
And the result should equal the correct Fibonacci number for that input
And the CPU units consumed should be recorded
And the memory units consumed should be recorded
And the execution should complete within budget limits
```

### Scenario: Execution Budget Compliance

```gherkin
Given a Fibonacci function is compiled and ready for execution
And the CEK machine has standard execution budget limits
When the function is executed with a target argument
Then the execution should not exceed CPU unit limits
And the execution should not exceed memory unit limits
And the computation should complete without budget exhaustion
```

## Test Verification Points

### Functional Correctness

- **Expected Result**: The computation must produce the mathematically correct Fibonacci number
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Multiple executions with the same input must produce identical results
- **Function Application**: The function must be fully-applied with the target argument during benchmarking

### Performance Compliance

- **CPU Budget**: Execution must complete within CEK machine CPU unit limits
- **Memory Budget**: Execution must complete within CEK machine memory unit limits
- **Resource Measurement**: All resource consumption must be accurately recorded

### Measurement Requirements

- **CPU Units**: Total execution units consumed during computation
- **Memory Units**: Peak memory usage during computation
- **Script Size**: Size of the compiled UPLC script in bytes
- **Term Size**: Size of the UPLC term representation

### Algorithm Verification

- **Base Cases**: `fibonacci(1) = 1` and `fibonacci(2) = 1`
- **Mathematical Sequence**: Must follow the correct Fibonacci sequence
- **Input Range**: Should handle positive integer inputs within reasonable bounds

## Implementation Independence

These behavioral scenarios are designed to be independent of the specific implementation approach:

- **Recursive Implementation**: Tests recursive function optimization
- **Iterative Implementation**: Tests loop optimization and memory efficiency
- **Memoized Implementation**: Tests memory management and caching strategies

All implementations must satisfy the same behavioral requirements while potentially showing different performance characteristics.
