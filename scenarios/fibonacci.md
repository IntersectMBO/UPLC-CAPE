**Target**: `fibonacci(25)` â†’ Expected result: `75025`  
**Metrics**: CPU units, Memory units, Script size (bytes), Term size  
**Constraints**: Plutus Core 1.1.0, Plutus V3 recommended, CEK machine budget limits  
**Implementation**: Choose recursive, iterative, or memoized approach

## Exact Task

Implement a Fibonacci function and compile it as a **fully-applied UPLC program** that computes the 25th Fibonacci number.

### Core Requirements

1. **Function Implementation**: Create a function that computes Fibonacci numbers using the mathematical definition:
   - `fibonacci(1) = 1`
   - `fibonacci(2) = 1`  
   - `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)` for n > 2

2. **Full Application**: The UPLC program must be fully-applied with the target value (25) baked in during compilation, not passed as a parameter.

3. **Target Computation**: `fibonacci(25)` must produce exactly `75025`

4. **Implementation Approach**: Choose any approach that works best for your compiler:
   - **Recursive**: Direct translation of mathematical definition
   - **Iterative**: Loop-based implementation for efficiency
   - **Memoized**: Cached computation for optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

Your submission passes if:

- âœ… **Correctness**: Program outputs exactly `75025`
- âœ… **Budget Compliance**: Executes within CEK machine CPU and memory limits
- âœ… **Determinism**: Produces identical results across multiple executions
- âœ… **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies or parameters
- âœ… **File Format**: Valid UPLC program that can be executed by the CEK evaluator

## Constraints and Notes

### Technical Constraints

- **Plutus Core Version**: Target Plutus Core 1.1.0
- **Plutus Version**: V3 recommended (V1, V2 acceptable)
- **Budget Limits**: Must complete within standard CEK machine execution limits
- **No External Dependencies**: Program must be self-contained
- **Deterministic**: Must produce consistent results

### Performance Context

**Why fibonacci(25)?**
- **Computationally Significant**: ~242,785 recursive calls in naive implementation
- **Budget Safe**: Fits comfortably within CEK machine limits
- **Optimization Sensitive**: Large enough to show compiler differences
- **Manageable**: Not so large as to create measurement difficulties

**Expected Performance Ranges** (approximate):
- **Recursive**: Higher CPU usage, demonstrates optimization capabilities
- **Iterative**: Lower CPU usage, more predictable memory patterns  
- **Memoized**: Moderate CPU, higher memory usage
