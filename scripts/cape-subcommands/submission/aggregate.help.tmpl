Usage: cape submission aggregate

Discovers all benchmark submissions and outputs CSV containing a row for each one:
- benchmark: The benchmark scenario name
- timestamp: ISO-8601 timestamp from metrics
- language: Compiler name (derived from metadata)
- version: Compiler version
- user: Contributor name
- cpu_units: CPU execution units consumed (sum aggregation)
- memory_units: Memory consumption (sum aggregation)
- script_size_bytes: Size of serialized UPLC script in bytes
- term_size: Number of AST nodes in the UPLC term
- submission_dir: Directory name of the submission

Output is printed to stdout in CSV format with headers.

Notes:
  - Each scenario is treated independently (fibonacci and fibonacci_naive_recursion are separate)
  - Uses 'sum' aggregation strategy for multi-test-case measurements
  - Submissions without metrics.json are skipped with a warning

Examples:
  cape submission aggregate > results.csv
  cape submission aggregate | head -10
