  cape submission list [scenario]

Arguments:
  [scenario]      Optional benchmark name to filter submissions

Examples:
  # List all submissions
  cape submission list

  # List submissions for specific scenario
  cape submission list fibonacci

  - Submissions are displayed sorted alphabetically
  - Each scenario is treated independently (fibonacci and fibonacci_naive_recursion are separate)
  - Use scenario-specific directories for prescribed algorithm benchmarks
