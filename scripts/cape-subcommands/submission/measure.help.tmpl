CAPE Submission Measure

USAGE:
    cape submission measure [OPTIONS] PATH
    cape submission measure --all

DESCRIPTION:
    Measure UPLC program(s) and generate metrics.json. This wrapper auto-discovers the
    scenario and verifier based on repository layout. No explicit scenario or verifier
    flags are supported here. Single-file mode via -i/-o is not supported in the wrapper.

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help            Show this help message
    -a, --all             Measure all submissions under submissions/
        --no-color        Disable colored output
        --verbose         Verbose output

BEHAVIOR:
    - Scenario is inferred from the path: submissions/<scenario>/<submission>/...
    - If scenarios/<scenario>/verifier.uplc exists, it is passed to the measure tool
      as the verifier (-v). If missing and the program does not reduce to unit, the
      measure tool exits with code 2.
    - metrics.json is created/updated alongside each .uplc file measured.

EXAMPLES:
    - Measure one submission folder:
        cape submission measure submissions/fibonacci/Plinth_1.52.0.0_User

    - Measure all submissions:
        cape submission measure --all
