CAPE Submission Measure

USAGE:
    cape submission measure [OPTIONS] ( --all | PATH | -i <file> -o <file> )

DESCRIPTION:
    Measures UPLC program performance including CPU units, memory units,
    script size, and term size. Creates or updates metrics.json files.

    You MUST explicitly choose one of the modes:
      --all                Measure every submission under submissions/
      PATH                 Measure all *.uplc files under a specific path
      -i FILE -o FILE      Measure a single UPLC file to specified metrics.json

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Show this help message
    -a, --all        Measure all submissions (cannot be combined with PATH or -i/-o)
    -i, --input      Input UPLC file (requires -o/--output)
    -o, --output     Output metrics.json file (requires -i/--input)
    -v, --verbose    Print detailed logs and tool output
        --no-color   Disable colored output

ARGUMENTS:
  PATH            Path to a directory containing .uplc files to measure.
                  Use '.' to measure only the current directory.

EXAMPLES:
    cape submission measure -i fibonacci.uplc -o metrics.json
    cape submission measure --all
    cape submission measure submissions/fibonacci/Plinth_1.52_Unisay
    cape submission measure .

NOTES:
    - Explicit mode selection prevents accidental measurement of all submissions.
    - The measure tool evaluates UPLC programs and extracts performance metrics.
    - Output metrics.json files follow the CAPE framework schema.
    - Requires the nix development shell with the measure tool available.
