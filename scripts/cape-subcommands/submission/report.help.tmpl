Usage: cape submission report [--dry-run] [--keep-existing] [--mode <base|open>] <benchmark>
       cape submission report [--dry-run] [--keep-existing] [--mode <base|open>] --all

Generate HTML performance reports with chart images comparing submission performance.

Arguments:
  <benchmark>    Name of the benchmark to generate report for
  --all          Generate reports for all benchmarks with submissions

Options:
  --dry-run       Show actions without writing files
  --keep-existing Do not delete the existing report/ directory before generating
  --mode <base|open>  Filter submissions by evaluation mode
                      Omit to show all modes (default)

The report includes:
- Main index page (report/index.html) listing all benchmarks
- Individual benchmark report pages (report/benchmarks/<benchmark>.html)
- 4 PNG chart images per benchmark comparing submissions by:
  - CPU Units: Execution cost in CPU units
  - Memory Units: Memory consumption
  - Script Size: Serialized UPLC script size in bytes
  - Term Size: Number of AST nodes in UPLC term

Each submission is labeled as: {language}_{version}_{user}

Output:
  report/index.html                           # Main index with all benchmarks
  report/benchmarks/<benchmark>.html          # Individual benchmark reports
  report/benchmarks/images/<benchmark>_*.png  # Chart image files

Examples:
  cape submission report fibonacci           # Report for fibonacci (all modes)
  cape submission report --all               # Reports for all benchmarks (all modes)
  cape submission report fibonacci --mode base    # Only base mode submissions
  cape submission report --all --mode open        # Only open mode submissions

Requirements:
  - gnuplot must be installed
  - Submissions must have metrics.json files (use 'cape submission measure')
