Usage: cape submission report [--dry-run] [--keep-existing] <benchmark>
       cape submission report [--dry-run] [--keep-existing] --all

Generate HTML performance reports with chart images comparing submission performance.

Arguments:
  <benchmark>    Name of the benchmark to generate report for
  --all          Generate reports for all benchmarks with submissions

Options:
  --dry-run       Show actions without writing files

The report includes:
- Main index page (report/index.html) listing all benchmarks
- Individual benchmark report pages (report/benchmarks/<benchmark>.html)
- 4 PNG chart images per benchmark comparing submissions by:
  - CPU Units: Execution cost in CPU units
  - Memory Units: Memory consumption
  - Script Size: Serialized UPLC script size in bytes
  - Term Size: Number of AST nodes in UPLC term

Each submission is labeled as: {language}_{version}_{user}

Output:
  report/index.html                           # Main index with all benchmarks
  report/benchmarks/<benchmark>.html          # Individual benchmark reports
  report/benchmarks/images/<benchmark>_*.png  # Chart image files

Examples:
  cape submission report fibonacci           # Report for fibonacci benchmark
  cape submission report --all               # Reports for all benchmarks

Requirements:
  - gnuplot must be installed
  - Submissions must have metrics.json files (use 'cape submission measure')
