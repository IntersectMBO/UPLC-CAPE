Usage: cape submission verify [OPTIONS] PATH

Verify a submission by running correctness (CEK + optional cape-tests.json) and
schema validation. This wrapper auto-discovers the scenario and test suite based
on repository layout. No explicit scenario or test flags are supported.

Options:
  -a, --all              Verify all submissions under submissions/
      --no-color         Disable colored output
      --verbose          Verbose output
  -h, --help             Show this help and exit

Behavior:
- Scenario is inferred from path: submissions/<scenario>/<submission>/...
- Cape-tests.json is REQUIRED at scenarios/<scenario>/cape-tests.json
- Test suite is passed to measure tool for comprehensive validation (-t)
- metrics.json is created/updated from measurement output.
- metrics.json and metadata.json are validated against schemas in
  submissions/TEMPLATE/.

Examples:
- Verify one submission folder:
    cape submission verify submissions/fibonacci/Plinth_1.52.0.0_User

- Verify all submissions:
    cape submission verify --all
