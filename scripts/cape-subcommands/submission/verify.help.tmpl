Usage: cape submission verify [OPTIONS] PATH

Verify a submission by running correctness (CEK + optional verifier) and
schema validation. This wrapper auto-discovers the scenario and verifier based
on repository layout. No explicit scenario or verifier flags are supported.

Options:
  -a, --all              Verify all submissions under submissions/
      --no-color         Disable colored output
      --verbose          Verbose output
  -h, --help             Show this help and exit

Behavior:
- Scenario is inferred from path: submissions/<scenario>/<submission>/...
- If scenarios/<scenario>/verifier.uplc exists, it is passed to the measure tool
  as the verifier (-v). If missing and the program does not reduce to unit, the
  measure tool exits with code 2 and verification fails.
- metrics.json is created/updated from measurement output.
- metrics.json and metadata.json are validated against schemas in
  submissions/TEMPLATE/.

Examples:
- Verify one submission folder:
    cape submission verify submissions/fibonacci/Plinth_1.52.0.0_User

- Verify all submissions:
    cape submission verify --all
