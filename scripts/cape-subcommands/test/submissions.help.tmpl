Usage:
  cape test submissions [options] [submission_path...]

Description:
  Validates UPLC submissions against their scenario test suites using the
  measure tool with --validate-only flag. This command can test all submissions
  or specific submissions provided as arguments.

  When no submission paths are provided, discovers all scenarios with cape-tests.json
  files and tests all corresponding UPLC submissions.

  When submission paths are provided, validates only those specific submissions.

Options:
  -h, --help    Show this help message

Arguments:
  submission_path   Path to specific submission directory (relative to submissions/)
                   Can be provided with or without the "submissions/" prefix
                   Multiple paths can be specified

Examples:
  cape test submissions                                    # Validate all UPLC submissions
  cape test submissions two-party-escrow/Plinth_1.52.0.0_Unisay  # Test specific submission
  cape test submissions fibonacci/Aiken_1.1.17_KtorZ fibonacci/Plinth_1.49.0.0_Unisay  # Test multiple submissions
  cape test submissions submissions/factorial/Plinth_1.52.0.0_Unisay  # Full path also works
  cape test submissions --help                            # Show this help

The submissions test:
- Discovers scenarios dynamically by scanning for cape-tests.json files
- Finds UPLC files in specified or all submission directories
- Runs measure tool with --validate-only flag for dry-run testing
- Reports pass/fail status for each scenario/submission combination
- Updates global test counters for integration with main test suite

Note: This command can run standalone or from within the main test suite.
In standalone mode, it uses the actual project directories directly.
