# linear_vesting Plinth 1.64.0.0 source

**Repository**: <https://github.com/Unisay/plinth-cape-submissions>

**Branch**: `main`

**Commit**: `5c014861ac6a7a0e85234ab8a7369a0c8f2adf20`

**Path**: `lib/LinearVesting.hs`

This submission compiles `lib/LinearVesting.hs` from the Plinth source
repository with the Plinth (plutus-tx-plugin) 1.64.0.0 line.

Production line with Plinth 1.64.0.0 (no BuiltinCasing). Plugin pragmas live in `plinth-cape-submissions.cabal`; validator modules carry no Plinth-specific options.

## Reproducing the compilation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Unisay/plinth-cape-submissions
cd plinth-cape-submissions
git checkout 5c014861ac6a7a0e85234ab8a7369a0c8f2adf20
```

`CAPE_REPO` must point at the sibling UPLC-CAPE checkout; the
build aborts if the variable is unset. The recommended place is
`.envrc.local` (gitignored), e.g.:

```sh
export CAPE_REPO="$HOME/src/UPLC-CAPE"
```

Then enter the dev shell and run the generator:

```bash
nix develop
cabal run plinth-submissions
```

The produced UPLC writes to
`$CAPE_REPO/submissions/linear_vesting/Plinth_1.64.0.0_Unisay/linear_vesting.uplc`
and matches the `linear_vesting.uplc` in this submission.
